<h2>Section 9: Regulatory traffic signs</h2>
<p>Regulatory signs show the course a driver <span class="text-danger">must</span> follow and an action they are
    required to take or forbidden to
    take. They are usually circular and have a red border and black symbols or letters on a white background.
    Mandatory regulatory signs that indicate the direction traffic <span class="text-danger">must</span> take at
    junctions are blue and white.

<p>The following is an alternative design for the 80kmh speed limit sign. This sign may be provided:</p>
<p>on a local road to indicate that a speed limit of 80kmh applies; or
    at a location where special speed limit bye-laws specify that the special speed limit of 80kmh applies in
    respect of a local road or part of a local road in a built-up area.

<h3>Appendix 5: Representative vehicles for the driving test</h3>
<p>To do the driving test, a person must use a vehicle type that represents the licensing category which they
    want to get a licence for. For example, if you want a licence to drive a truck, then you must come to the
    test and be tested in a truck. In this way, the test applicant is tested using a vehicle that allows them to
    show they will be capable of driving any vehicle in the broader licence category if they pass the test. The
    test requirements reflect a typical vehicle in the mid-range of the particular category.</p>
<p>Please note that maximum authorised mass (MAM) is also known as design gross vehicle weight (DGVW). Please
