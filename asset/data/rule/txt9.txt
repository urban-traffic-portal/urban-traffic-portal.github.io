        <h2>Section 9: Regulatory traffic signs</h2>
        <p>Regulatory signs show the course a driver <span class="text-danger">must</span> follow and an action they are
            required to take or forbidden to
            take. They are usually circular and have a red border and black symbols or letters on a white background.
            Mandatory regulatory signs that indicate the direction traffic <span class="text-danger">must</span> take at
            junctions are blue and white.

        <p>The following is an alternative design for the 80kmh speed limit sign. This sign may be provided:</p>
        <p>on a local road to indicate that a speed limit of 80kmh applies; or
            at a location where special speed limit bye-laws specify that the special speed limit of 80kmh applies in
            respect of a local road or part of a local road in a built-up area.

        <h3>Appendix 5: Representative vehicles for the driving test</h3>
        <p>To do the driving test, a person must use a vehicle type that represents the licensing category which they
            want to get a licence for. For example, if you want a licence to drive a truck, then you must come to the
            test and be tested in a truck. In this way, the test applicant is tested using a vehicle that allows them to
            show they will be capable of driving any vehicle in the broader licence category if they pass the test. The
            test requirements reflect a typical vehicle in the mid-range of the particular category.</p>
