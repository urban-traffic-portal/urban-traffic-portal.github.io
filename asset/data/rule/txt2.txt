        <h2>Section 2: The learner driver</h2>
        <h4><span class="text-info">Conditions for learner permit holders</span></h4>
        <p>When you are a learner driver you <span class="text-danger">must</span>, in addition to answering yes to the
            questions on pages 24–25, comply
            with the following conditions:</p>
        <p>1) Accompanied when driving</p>
        <p>A holder of a learner permit for categories B, BE, C, C1, C1E, CE, D, D1, D1E and DE <span

            fixed charge fine and up to 4 penalty points.</p>
        <p>Learner permit holders for categories A, A1, A2 and AM <span class="text-danger">must</span> display ‘L’

        <p><span class="text-danger">It is illegal to give driving instruction for payment or reward to learner drivers
                if
                you are not registered with the Road Safety Authority. A list of all Approved Driving Instructors (ADI)

            (EDT) with an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI). [See www.rsa.ie for an up to date list of ADIs.]</p>
        <p><span class="text-danger">Be sure to confirm with your ADI what type of lesson you are booking for your next

            approved IBT instructor, before they can ride a motorcycle unsupervised.</p>
        <p><span class="text-danger">Until they hold their full licence, motorcyclists must carry their IBT certificate
                when riding without an IBT trainer.</span></p>
        <p>Until they hold their full licence, motorcyclists must carry their IBT certificate when riding without an IBT
            trainer.</p>
        <p>As a learner permit holder, you <span class="text-danger">must not</span> drive on a motorway. It is an
            offence to do so.</p>
        <p>7) Trailers</p>
        <p>Learner permit holders driving vehicles in Categories B, C, C1, D or D1 (cars, trucks or buses) must not tow
            a trailer.</p>
        <p>8) Carrying Passengers</p>
        <p>A person who holds a learner permit for:
            Any category <span class="text-danger">must not</span> carry any passenger for payment or reward.
        </p>
        <p>A person who holds a learner permit for category W (for example, a work vehicle or land tractor) <span
                class="text-danger">must not</span>
            carry a passenger unless the vehicle is constructed or adapted to carry a passenger and the passenger is a
            qualified driver.</p>
        <p>A person who holds a learner permit for category A1, A2, A or AM (motorcycle or moped) <span
                class="text-danger">must not</span> carry a passenger.</p>
        <p>9) Motorcycles</p>
        <p>Category A2 learner permit holders are entitled to drive motorcycles with: </p>
        <p>An engine power output of 35kW or less, or
            A power to weight ratio of 0.2kW per kg or less.
        </p>
        <p>It is your responsibility to check the power of the motorcycle. If you are in any doubt, consult with the
            dealer or manufacturer.</p>
        <h4><span class="text-info">If your learner permit runs out</span></h4>
        <p>If you have not taken the test, you <span class="text-danger">must</span>:
            give evidence that you applied to sit your driving test for that category of vehicle; or
            satisfy the NDLS that because of illness (as certified by a registered medical practitioner), you were not
            in a position to take a driving test.</p>
        <p>If you are a first time holder of a learner permit for categories A, A2, A1, AM, B or W, that is, if you
            haven’t held a learner permit in the category before, or a previous permit has expired by more than five
            years, you are not allowed to take a driving test for at least six months after the start date of the
            permit. This provision is to allow you to gain experience of driving. Research shows that the longer a
            learner is supervised while driving, the less likely they are to be involved in a collision.</p>
        <p>This rule does not apply to: category BE vehicles;
            a higher category of motorcycle where you have passed Initial Basic Training (IBT) and a driving test on a
            lower category of motorcycle and you hold the category for a minimum of 2 years;
            a holder of a current full driving licence in the category from another country for more than six months,
            provided the holder forwards to the RSA a current original full driving licence and a letter of entitlement
            from the recognised licensing authority in that country.
