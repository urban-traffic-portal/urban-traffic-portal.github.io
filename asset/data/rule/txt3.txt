        <h4><span class="text-info">How to apply for your driving test</span></h4>
        <p>To take a Driving Test you <span class="text-danger">must</span>:</p>

            on the day of the test (this applies to cars, motorcycles and work vehicles);</p>
        <p>There are certain exceptions to the six-month rule. For example, learner permit holders in category BE (car
            or van and trailer) do not need to wait 6 months before doing a practical driving test in that category. See
            further exceptions to the six-month rule at page 32.</p>

        <h4><span class="class-info">Secondary controls and technical checks</span></h4>
        <p>At your test, you will have to:</p>
        <p>work the secondary controls, such as windscreen wipers and washers, de-misters, rear window heater, lights
            and air-conditioning, fans, rear foglights, air vents and temperature control.</p>

        <p><span class="text-danger">Motorcyclists are further tested on: control of speed, control when braking and
                avoiding obstacles.</span></p>
        <h4><span class="class-info">How long does the test last?</span></h4>
        <p>The test for categories A, A1, A2, AM, B, BE and W vehicles lasts about 40 minutes and assesses your driving
            skills over a distance of about 8 to 10 kilometres.</p>
        <p>The test for vehicles in other categories lasts about 70 minutes and assesses your driving skills over about
            20 kilometres.</p>
        <h4><span class="class-info">What happens when your test is finished?</span></h4>
        <p>Your Certificate of Competency will list any restrictions to be applied to your licence. Any restrictions
            will be shown on your driving licence by using a particular code. Further information on potential
            restrictions on a driving licence is available on the RSA website, www.rsa.ie.</p>
        <p>If you are not successful in your driving test, you will receive a detailed report on the faults that
            occurred during the test. When you are preparing for your next test, pay particular attention to these
            faults while continuing to work on other areas of your driving.</p>
        <h4><span class="class-info">What to do if you are not happy with your test result</span></h4>
        <p>If you were not successful and believe that your driving test was not conducted properly or fairly, you may
            appeal the tester’s decision to the District Court. The District Court may either refuse the appeal or, if
            it finds that the test was not properly conducted, it can direct the Road Safety Authority to give you
            another test free of charge.</p>
